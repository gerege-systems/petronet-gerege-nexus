# PetroNet System

**Integrated Digital Operations Platform**

**PetroNet System** is an open-source modular platform that connects services,
operations, systems, and data across public and private organizations. It is
**Mongolian-first** and integrates directly with Mongolia's national digital
infrastructure (DAN, E-ID, XYP / ХУР).

*Nexus* is the connection point: where organizations, services, workflows,
systems, users and data meet. The platform itself is not tied to one sector —
the modules running on it are what make a deployment specific.

Modules compile into a single Go binary, while a PostgreSQL-backed app
store decides which apps are active per tenant — module separation without the
network hops or operational cost of microservices.

**Language policy: Mongolian plus the six official languages of the United
Nations** — Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish. Seven in total.
Mongolian is the source. This product overview exists in all seven languages;
individual technical documents do not necessarily do so. The UI has Mongolian
and English source dictionaries plus Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian, and
Spanish overlays; missing overlay strings fall back to English. See the
[translation guide](TRANSLATION.md).

## Core capabilities

### 1. High-performance modular monolith

- **Compile-time Go app modules** — core carries only `sso_clients`.
  Product distributions register their modules through the public `pkg/nexus`
  contract in the final binary, where they are invoked in-process.
- **Per-tenant app store** — application entitlements, menus and RBAC are driven
  from PostgreSQL (`app_installations`).
- **Dependency resolver** — recursive resolution over a directed acyclic graph
  with cycle detection and semver constraint checking.
- **Catalog sync** — production fetches a signed catalog from
  `APP_CATALOG_URL`; development/offline mode falls back to
  `catalog/apps.json`, and metadata is reconciled into `platform.apps`.

### 2. Cloud-native resilience and multiple replicas

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `internal/kernel/resilience/loadshedder.go` | Sheds load with `503` + `Retry-After` under pressure |
| `internal/kernel/cache/bus.go` | Redis-backed invalidation across replicas, with a local fallback |
| `internal/kernel/memo/memo.go` | Short-TTL, prefix-invalidated local cache for authorisation decisions |
| `internal/kernel/async/async.go` | Named goroutines with panic recovery and stack logging |

### 3. National digital infrastructure

- **XYP — State Information Exchange** (`internal/workspace/identity/gerege/xyp.go`): citizen civil
  registration (`WS100101`) and legal entity verification (`WS100201`).
- **National E-ID and DAN** ([`developer.gerege.mn`](https://developer.gerege.mn),
  [`eidmongolia.mn`](https://eidmongolia.mn)) — PKI digital signature, mobile
  OTP, bank SSO and biometric face verification.
- **Built-in OAuth2 / OIDC provider**
  (`/.well-known/openid-configuration`) issuing client-credentials tokens to
  third-party systems.
- **Email verification** (`internal/workspace/emailverify`) — one shared flow for proving
  an address, called in process by every app module. The mail is sent by the
  hosted service (`enigma.mn`), so the platform holds no mailbox credential and
  owns no sender address; the verification is recorded when the person comes
  back, and that return works exactly once. Visible under Settings → Email
  verification.

> **Note.** Mock mode for E-ID, DAN and XYP is a development convenience only.
> With `ENVIRONMENT=production` it is disabled automatically, so a fabricated
> registration number can never authenticate.

### 4. AI copilot and analytics

- **AI assistant** (`internal/workspace/ai/copilot.go`) — intent-classified conversation
  wired to live tenant data.
- **Stock forecast endpoint** (`internal/workspace/ai/handlers.go`) — delegates to
  an enabled distribution's `stock_forecast` capability and returns `404` when
  no module provides it.

## Business applications

This base repository ships exactly one app in `catalog/apps.json`. Product
distributions register their own modules and migrations through `pkg/nexus`;
their apps must not be read as features included in this repository.

| # | Application | ID | Route | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | SSO Clients | `io.gerege.nexus.sso_clients` | `/sso-clients` | OAuth2 clients for systems that sign people in through this platform |

Routes only open once the app is installed and enabled for the tenant; otherwise
the gate returns `403 Forbidden`.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.26+
- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL 16+ (or Docker Compose)

### 1. Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Migrations run as a dedicated one-shot `migrate` service before the API starts.

### 2. Manual

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
go mod download
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgrespassword@localhost:5432/platform_db?sslmode=disable" \
  go run ./cmd/migrate up
go run ./cmd/api
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Demo credentials

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Email | `admin@example.com` |
| Password | `Password123!` |
| Tenant | `Demo Corporation` (`slug: demo`) |

The demo account is only seeded outside production. In production it is created
only when `SEED_DEMO_DATA=true` is set explicitly.

---

## Automated deployment

Every push to `main` runs [`deploy.yml`](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml):

1. Build and push the backend and frontend images to GHCR (`:latest` and `:<sha>`).
2. Copy `docker-compose.prod.yml` to the server.
3. Write the server `.env` from GitHub secrets and pull the images.
4. Run migrations to completion, then swap the API and frontend over.
5. Probe `/health` and `/ready`, printing container logs and failing the run if
   the rollout is unhealthy.

Deploy manually from Actions → *Deploy to Production* → **Run workflow**,
optionally pinning an image tag.

Required repository secrets:

| Secret | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` | Yes | Private key of the deploy user. Without it the rollout is skipped |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | Yes | Database password on the server |
| `SSO_DEFAULT_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes | Mandatory for the built-in OAuth2 client in production |
| `DEPLOY_HOST` / `DEPLOY_USER` / `DEPLOY_PORT` | No | Default to `petronet.mn` / `deploy` / `22` |
| `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` | No | Defaults to `https://petronet.mn` |

> The production domain is `petronet.mn`, which replaced
> `openerp.gerege.mn` in the PetroNet System rename. `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` defines CORS,
> the OIDC issuer and the eID callback in one place, so moving it carries DNS,
> the TLS certificate and every client that pinned the issuer along with it.

The server needs Docker only — no source tree and no Go/Node toolchain. See
[`deploy/.env.prod.example`](../deploy/.env.prod.example) for the values.

`Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

---

## Testing and quality gates

```bash
# Backend unit tests with the race detector
cd backend && go test -race ./...

# Static analysis
cd backend && go vet ./... && golangci-lint run

# Vulnerability scan
cd backend && govulncheck ./...

# Frontend build
cd frontend && npm run build
```

CI runs lint, tests, the frontend build, the Docker image build, govulncheck and
gosec on every push and pull request.

---

## Security

- Session tokens are 256-bit random values; only their SHA-256 digest is stored.
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt and login attempts are rate limited per IP.
- Installing, enabling or disabling apps and registering integrations require
  tenant administrator rights.
- OAuth2 client authentication uses constant-time comparison.

Report vulnerabilities as described in [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md).
