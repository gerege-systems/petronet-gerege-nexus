/**
 * Assemble an MkDocs tree from the repository's own Markdown.
 *
 * docs.gerege.mn is built with MkDocs and Material for MkDocs, and this site is
 * built the same way so the two read as one set of documentation rather than
 * two products that happen to share a company.
 *
 * The page list is NOT duplicated here. It is imported from ./pages.mjs,
 * which already decides what is publishable, what it is called, and which group
 * it belongs to. Two lists would drift, and the one that drifts is always the
 * one nobody is looking at.
 *
 * MkDocs reads a single docs_dir, and half of these files live at the
 * repository root (README, CHANGELOG, SECURITY…). So the tree is staged into
 * build/docs rather than pointed at in place, and the links between pages are
 * rewritten to match.
