 * advertise nine of them. Saying so used to mean forking the frontend — the
 * same fork `lib/brandCopy.ts` exists to prevent, on the same reasoning. That
 * file gave a deployment's *words* a home in configuration; this gives its
 * page *shape* one, because rewriting a section's prose does not help when the
 * honest answer is that the section does not apply.
 *
 * The default is every section in the order this page has always rendered
 * them, so a deployment that names nothing sees exactly what it saw before.
