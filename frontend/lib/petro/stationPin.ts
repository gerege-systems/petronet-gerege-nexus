/**
 * The pin a filling station is drawn as.
 *
 * A teardrop in the operator's colour with a fuel pump on it. It replaced a
 * coloured circle, which said "something is here" and left the reader to work
 * out what — on a map that already carries POI dots, a plain circle is one more
 * dot among them.
 *
 * # Why images rather than one icon tinted per feature
 *
 * MapLibre cannot recolour an icon from a data expression: `icon-color` applies
 * only to SDF images, and an SDF is single-channel, so the white pump on a
 * coloured ground could not survive it. One image per colour is the way to keep
 * both the brand colour and the glyph, and there are six of them — five
 * operators with more than forty stations, and everybody else.
 *
 * They are generated here rather than shipped as files. A PNG per brand in
 * /public would be six assets to redraw the day the palette moves, and the
 * palette is a product decision that will move.
