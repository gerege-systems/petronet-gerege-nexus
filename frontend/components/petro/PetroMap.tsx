 * Where to buy fuel — the citizen's map, and this deployment's front page.

 * Rendered by app/page.tsx at `/`, which components/Layout.tsx already treats as
 * public: Layout returns the children and nothing else, so there is no sidebar,
 * no app rail and no organisation switcher around it. Those belong to somebody
 * administering a company. A driver looking for petrol is not administering
 * anything and, on a first visit, has no session at all.
 *
 * It replaced the platform's marketing landing page. That page argues for the
 * platform to somebody choosing one; this deployment's visitor has already
 * arrived and wants to know where the fuel is.

 * # Why a GeoJSON source and not markers
 *
 * Up to 300 stations in a viewport. Three hundred DOM markers is three hundred
 * absolutely-positioned elements that the browser re-lays-out on every frame of
 * a pan; a GeoJSON source with a circle layer is drawn by the GPU in one pass
 * and stays smooth on a phone. It also lets the brand colour come from a data
 * expression rather than from JavaScript deciding per marker.
