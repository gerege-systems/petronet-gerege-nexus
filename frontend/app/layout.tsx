 * an image carrying a name is an image one customer owns. It is the same
 * reasoning `lib/apiBase.ts` sets out for the address, and it costs the same
 * thing: the static HTML for these screens is no longer prebuilt. Cheap here,
 * because there was little to prebuild. Every screen under this layout is
 * either behind a session or already rendered per request (the landing page
 * fetches the storefront on the server), so what was being cached was the empty
