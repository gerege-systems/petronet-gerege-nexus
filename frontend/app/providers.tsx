/**
 * Everything under the document that has to run in the browser.
 *
 * This used to be the root layout itself, which was a client component so the
 * providers could live in it. The brand is what split them: it is read from the
 * environment at request time, and only a server component can read it, so the
 * root became one and this file took the providers. The file comment there
 * once called that split larger than the metadata warranted — it was, for
 * metadata; a name the image is not allowed to know is a different bargain.
 *
 * The brand is passed down rather than fetched: it is in the first byte of HTML
 * the server sends, so no screen shows one product's name and then swaps it.
 * The deployment's wording travels the same way and for the same reason.
