 * Every reason the server can send back to the sign-in screen.
 *
 * A failed sign-in comes back as `/login?sso_error=<reason>`, and the screen
 * turns that word into a sentence. A reason with no entry falls to the generic
 * message, which is the right default and a poor place to end up by accident:
 * `binding_failed` spent its life as `no_account`, so somebody three clicks
 * from opening an account was told to ask their administrator for one.
 *
 * So the vocabulary is asserted rather than assumed. A new reason on the Go
 * side has to be either given a sentence or listed below as deliberately
 * generic — which is a decision, made once, in the open.
