/**
 * The console hides buttons a role may not press, from a copy of the server's
 * capability table.
 *
 * The copy has to exist — the server answers 403 whatever the browser thinks,
 * and a console that offers an action the server will refuse is a console that
 * teaches its operators to expect failure. What the copy must not do is drift:
 * a capability moved between roles in Go and left alone here shows `support`
 * a Delete button that cannot work, or — the direction that matters — hides
 * from `operator` a button they are entitled to and nobody notices for months,
 * because a missing button looks exactly like a feature that does not exist.
 *
 * Both sides are read as text. The Go map is the authority; the TypeScript
 * copy names a subset of the capabilities, and every one it names has to agree.
