/**
 * Which addresses the shell may draw without a session.
 *
 * The rule this file checks is one line of code and two weeks of a Google
 * button that did nothing. `/login/bind` — where a first Google sign-in lands
 * to be verified once with eID — was not in the list, so the shell asked
 * `/api/v1/me` for somebody who by definition has no session, took the 401 and
 * pushed them back to `/login`. Nothing failed and nothing was reported: the
 * screen the flow was carrying them to was simply never drawn.
 *
 * So the list is asserted by intent rather than by contents. Each name below
 * says why that address must render for somebody who is not signed in, which
 * is the question the next person adding a screen to the sign-in area has to
 * answer.
