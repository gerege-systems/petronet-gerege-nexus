 * Tankers on their way to a forecourt.
 *
 * # What a citizen is told, and what they are not
 *
 * A fuel tanker is hazardous cargo. Publishing the live position of every one
 * in the country, unauthenticated, is also publishing a target list — so what
 * leaves this file is the smallest set that answers "when does the fuel get
 * here": where the vehicle is, where it is going, what it is carrying and when
 * it should arrive.
 *
 * Withheld deliberately, and each for its own reason:
 *
 *	driver_name, driver_phone   a person's own details, and irrelevant to the
 *	                            question anybody is asking
 *	seal_no                     the seal is a control; knowing its number is
 *	                            the first step in defeating it
 *	volume_liters               the same competitive read the stock endpoint
 *	                            withholds, arriving by another route
 *
 * If a deployment decides the position itself should not be public either, the
 * change is to drop two fields from PublicTrip — the operator's view, which is
 * gated, already carries everything.
