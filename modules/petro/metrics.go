 * The chain, as numbers a dashboard can watch.
 *
 * Everything else this module exposes answers a question somebody asked: an
 * operator opening a screen, a citizen tapping a station. These answer the
 * question nobody is awake to ask — is fuel still moving, and is it moving at
 * every point on the chain or only at some of them.
 *
 * # Why it is national, and has no tenant label
 *
 * Prometheus keeps what it is given for sixty days and Grafana's access
 * controls are coarser than the platform's. A `tenant` label here would put one
 * company's stock curve, delivery cadence and turnover in front of whoever
 * holds a dashboard login — a competitor's read of a business, published by
 * accident and then kept for two months. The national figure carries what an
 * operations dashboard is for, and carries nothing a rival could act on.
 *
 * The same rule as FUELNET_OVERSIGHT_PLAN.md sets for the regulator's queries:
 * COUNT and SUM, never a row. `petro_vouchers.citizen_id` appears nowhere below,
 * not even inside a COUNT DISTINCT that could later be relaxed into a GROUP BY.
 *
 * # Why the queries run on scrape
 *
 * Prometheus asks every fifteen seconds and these are seven aggregate queries
 * over small tables. A cache refreshed on its own timer would be a second
 * schedule to reason about and a window in which the dashboard shows a number
 * that was true a minute ago — which is exactly the failure `stock_age` below
 * exists to make visible. If they ever become expensive the answer is a
 * materialised view, not a goroutine.
