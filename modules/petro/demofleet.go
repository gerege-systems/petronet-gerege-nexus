 * Keeping invented lorries on the road.
 *
 * cmd/petro-demo-trips puts a fleet out once. Every run then arrives, and half an
 * hour later the map is empty — which is a fair picture of a dispatch board
 * nobody is operating, and a poor demonstration of one that is.
 *
 * This closes the loop: arrived runs are marked done and replacements are
 * dispatched, so the board stays populated without anybody re-running a command.
 *
 * # It is off unless asked for
 *
 * FUEL_DEMO_DISPATCH=true. A deployment carrying real dispatch data must never
 * find invented lorries appearing beside it, and "the demo seeder was left on"
 * is exactly the kind of thing that survives into production when the default
 * is the convenient one. Everything it writes carries source='demo', so what it
 * made is always separable from what an operator did.
