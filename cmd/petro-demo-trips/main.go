 * Tankers on the road, invented.
 *
 * Scaffolding, like cmd/petro-import's -demo-stock: real runs are dispatched by
 * an operator and tracked by a device in the cab. This exists so the map has
 * something moving on it before either of those is built, and so the shape of
 * the screen can be argued about against something rather than a mock.
 *
 * # Nothing here moves anything
 *
 * A trip is written once, with an origin, a destination and a window —
 * `departed_at` to `eta_at`. Where the lorry *is* comes out of that window when
 * somebody asks, in dispatch.go. So the vehicles slide along the map in real
 * time with no ticker running, no writes, and no background job to leak a
 * database connection; they simply arrive when their ETA passes and drop off
 * the map. Re-run this to put a fresh set on the road.
 *
